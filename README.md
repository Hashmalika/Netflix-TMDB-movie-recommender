## Netflix Movie recommender

Overview

This project is a Netflix movie recommendation system that suggests movies based on content similarity. It processes a dataset of movies and applies machine learning techniques to recommend similar movies.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:
- **id**: Unique identifier for each movie.
- **title**: Title of the movie.
- **vote_average**: Average user rating of the movie.
- **vote_count**: Number of votes the movie has received.
- **status**: Current status of the movie (e.g., released, upcoming).
- **release_date**: Date when the movie was released.
- **revenue**: Revenue generated by the movie.
- **runtime**: Duration of the movie in minutes.
- **adult**: Indicates if the movie is rated for adults.
- **backdrop_path**: URL to the backdrop image.
- **budget**: Budget allocated for the movie.
- **homepage**: Official homepage URL of the movie.
- **imdb_id**: IMDb identifier for the movie.
- **original_language**: Language of the movie.
- **original_title**: Original title of the movie.
- **overview**: Brief description of the movie.
- **popularity**: Popularity score based on social interactions and other metrics.
- **poster_path**: URL to the poster image.
- **tagline**: Tagline for the movie.
- **genres**: Genres associated with the movie.
- **production_companies**: List of companies that produced the movie.
- **production_countries**: Countries where the movie was produced.
- **spoken_languages**: Languages in which the movie is available.

### Data Processing

To optimize the dataset for movie prediction, the following changes were made:

1. The **tags** column was created by combining the **overview** and **genres** columns.
2. The **overview** and **genres** columns were dropped, leaving only the **id**, **title**, and **tags** columns for movie prediction purposes.
Features and Methodology

##Features and Methodology

Feature Selection:
Bag of Words
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert tags into numerical vectors.

Similarity Measurement:
Cosine similarity is used to measure the closeness between movie vectors.
If the angle between two movie vectors is small, they are considered similar.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a movie recommendation system that suggests movies based on historical data from Netflix's TMDB platform. By analyzing movie features such as the title, tags (combined overview and genres),  the model provides movie recommendations tailored to individual user preferences.

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: The primary programming language for data manipulation and model development.
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building machine learning models.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and experimentation.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing data and results.
- **Streamlit**: For creating an interactive web interface.
- **Pickle**: For loading preprocessed data (movie list and similarity index).
- **Requests**: For making HTTP requests (if required for external APIs).
